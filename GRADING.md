# Grading Schema
Here's a breakdown of the project calculation based on the provided weights:

1.  **Conceptual Design**: 25 marks
2.  **Reduction to Relation Schemas**: 25 marks
3.  **DDL File**: 10 marks
4.  **DML File**: 10 marks
5.  **Implementation**: 30 marks
6.  **Bonus Features**: 30 marks (10 bonus features) + (20 related to group number of members)

### Explanation:

1.  **Conceptual Design (25 marks)**:
    
    -   Clear and comprehensive explanation of the conceptual design using an ER-diagram.
    -   Assumptions aligned with project requirements.
    -   Properly defined cardinalities and participation types.
2.  **Reduction to Relation Schemas (25 marks)**:
    
    -   Effective mapping of the ER-diagram to relational schemas.
    -   Proper identification of tables, attributes, and relationships.
3.  **DDL File (10 marks)**:
    
    -   Successful transformation of relational schemas into DDL statements.
    -   Inclusion of primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and other constraints.
    -   Accuracy and completeness of the DDL file.
4.  **DML File (10 marks)**:
    
    -   Inclusion of insert statements for sample data in each table.
    -   Sample data should be relevant and sufficient to demonstrate the application's functionality.
5.  **Implementation (30 marks)**:
    
    -   Each feature outlined in the project requirements should have a corresponding function or method in the implementation.
    -   Proper functionality and integration with the database.
6.  **Bonus (30 marks)**:
    
    -   **Bonus Features**:
        -   The project allows for the addition of 10% bonus marks (max 10 marks) assessed based on the effort invested and the level of novelty introduced.
        -   Web applications and desktop applications will be considered bonus features as interfaces. A command-line interface is the basic answer without bonus marks.
    -   **Group Bonus**:
        -   Groups consisting of one student will receive a bonus equivalent to 20% of the individual student's mark, which is not calculated from the total mark.
        -   Groups consisting of two students will receive a bonus equivalent to 10% of the individual student's mark, which is also not calculated from the total mark.

### Total Marks:

The total marks for the project will be the sum of the marks obtained in each section, up to a maximum of 100 marks (without bonus) and 130 marks (with bonus).

## **How will project marks be added to the final grade?**

Let's break down how the project grade, which is out of 100, will be mapped to the overall final grade based on the provided weight distribution:

1.  **Assignments**: 30%
2.  **Project**: 30%
3.  **Final (Centrally Scheduled Exam)**: 40%

### Calculations:

-   **Project**: 30% of the final grade.
    -   Maximum project grade: 130/100 (including bonus).
    -   If a student receives 39/30 (equivalent to 130/100), it means they've achieved the maximum score allocated for the project.
-   **Assignments**: 30% of the final grade.
    -   If a student receives 25/30 for assignments, it means they've achieved 25/30 of the total marks allocated for assignments.
-   **Final Exam**: 40% of the final grade.
    -   If a student receives 30/40 for the final exam, it means they've achieved 30/40 of the total marks allocated for the final exam.
-   **Bonus Assignment (Relational Algebra Calculator)**: 5 extra marks (out of 5).

### Total Grade Calculation:
```
To calculate the total grade out of 100 based on the provided weights:

Total Grade = (Assignment Grade + Project Grade + Final Exam Grade + Bonus Assignment Grade) / Total Weight

Using the example:

-   Assignment Grade: 25/30
-   Project Grade: 39/30
-   Final Exam Grade: 30/40
-   Bonus Assignment Grade: 5/5

The total grade would be:

Total Grade = (25 + 39 + 30 + 5) / 100 = 99/100

Therefore, the student's final grade would be 99 out of 100.
